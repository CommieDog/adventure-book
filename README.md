## **Description**

Adventure Book is a modern web application used for travelers who want to get a better understanding of the "must see" places when traveling. Instead of digging through a bunch of separate blogs, travel agents, or websites to find the best spots while traveling, Adventure Book offers the user to create and explore different posts from past travelers, linked by tags. This gives the user a chance to find the less touristy places and understand the worlds culture all that much more in a simple, yet highly effective way.
